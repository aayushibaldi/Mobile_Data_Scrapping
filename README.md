# Mobile_Data_Scrapping
scrapped data from https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/phone-finder


1. First I have scrapped brand links from site https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/all-brands and stored in a csv file.
2. Using the csv file in step 1 I have scrapped links to each mobile and stored in another csv file
3. Using the csv file created in step 2 I have scrapped and stored the required data in mobile_ratings.csv
